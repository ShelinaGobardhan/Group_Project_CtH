	<h1>The Movie Selector</h1>
	<p>Since the day Edison made it possible to make film, people made millions of movies. 
	When you would like to watch one of those, sometimes it's hard to decide which one to watch. 
	Wouldn't it be nice if there was some generator to help you decide? 
	The Movie Selector steps in to do this for you! By telling us your mood, with whom 
	you would like to watch a movie or which actor has to be in it, we will find you the best options!
